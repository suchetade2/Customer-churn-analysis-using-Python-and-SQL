# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using Python and MySQL.  
The goal is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable business insights.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Customer Churn Dataset)
- Format: CSV
- Size: Large dataset with customer demographics, usage behavior, and churn status

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- MySQL
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Churn Analysis using SQL Queries
5. Data Visualization
6. Business Insights and Conclusions

## Key Analysis
- Churn distribution
- Churn vs tenure
- Impact of usage frequency and support calls
- Subscription type and contract length analysis

## Business Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure have higher churn rates
- Higher support calls indicate higher churn probability
- Long-term contracts reduce churn significantly
